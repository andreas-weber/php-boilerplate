# Boilerplate for PHP projects

This project can be used as a boilerplate for PHP projects.

## Why should I use this?

- Dedicated environment per php project
- Share your environment with other developers
- Fully pre configured to kick start your new project
- Use a massive toolchain to make developing a great pleasure

## Getting started 

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
```

After you've connected to your new installed virtual machine, you are ready to start coding.

## Features

### Vagrant

Use vagrant to easily bring up your virtual development machine.

### Puppet

Puppet is used to manage your development infrastructure.

### Debugging

Pre-Configured to debug with ease, using X-Debug.

### Build Targets

Build targets are used to generate code metrics, run unit tests and many more recurring tasks.

### Composer

Composer is installed by default. Just call it.

```
vagrant@boilerplate:/vagrant$ composer
